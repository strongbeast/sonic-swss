'''
Provides test cases for the "bitmap" VNET implementation.
Test cases are inherited from "test_vnet.py::TestVnetOrch" since they are the same for both "legacy" and "bitmap" implementation.
Difference between these two implementations is in set SAI attributes, so different values should be checked in ASIC_DB.
This class should override "get_vnet_obj()" method in order to return object with appropriate implementation of "check" APIs.
